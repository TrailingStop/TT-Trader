# TT-Trader
I plan to make TT-Miner open-source. To make this happend I'm looking for someone with experience and the time to manage the TT-Miner github page. If you have any interest and have the time please drop me a mail to droste@TradeProject.de.

I will open soon the TT-Trader github. An application to run algos on crypto futures. This will be free of charge if you use my link to open the account. For those who cannot program in C++ I will be happy to develop the algo for you. NDA is no problem.

For BitMart the link is: https://www.bitmart.com/invite/c6nXwm/en-US

I can also help to get a fee-discount arrangement. Just let me know if you are interested. Please use the same mail as mentioned above.

Thanks all.
